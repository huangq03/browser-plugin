    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how the "URL Decoder &amp;&amp; JSON Formatter" Chrome extension (the "Extension") collects, uses, and shares information when you use it.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Selected Text:</strong> The Extension only accesses text that you explicitly select on web pages when using the URL decoding or JSON formatting features. This text is used solely within the context of performing the requested operation (URL decoding or JSON formatting) and is not stored, transmitted, or shared with any third - parties.</p>
    <p><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, or browsing history through the Extension.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect (selected text) is used exclusively to provide the URL decoding and JSON formatting services. Once the operation is complete, the processed text is only displayed within the Extension's popup window and is not retained.</p>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any information collected by the Extension with third - parties. The selected text is processed locally in your browser and is not transmitted over the internet.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information processed by the Extension. Since all processing occurs locally in your browser, there is no risk of data interception during transmission.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
